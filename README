This is a tool for providing extended "ls" on FAT16 disk
images. It's different from "mtools" because it provides
offset of file dirent. This offset is rarely needed, the
only known application ATM is creating .PLA playlist for
MOTO P2K phones.
It is covered by simplified BSD licence (NetBSD variant).
